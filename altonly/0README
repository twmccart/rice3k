These files were produced by Murat on Karst in his first attempts at this 20 cultivar phylogeny thing. /N/dc2/projects/brendelgroup/3krgp/rice3k/calls
They were generated by GATK GenotypeGVCFs WITHOUT the -allSites option, meaning they should only contain SNPs and Indels and other variations from the reference genome. 
I'm annotating them with annotations from IRGSP 1
