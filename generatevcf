# The GATK tool GenotypeGVCFs takes the gvcf file and produces a normal vcf.
# The option -allSites is necessary for our purposes, so that called sites that match the reference will be able to be compared to SNPs in other cultivars.

# Before merging VCFs from different cultivars, it is useful to remove indels and uncalled or heterozygous sites with "bcftools view".
# It is also expedient to split the VCF by chromosome so that merges can be performed with some degree of parallelism.
